Determining equipment needs for each jurisdiction, entity or other party (each a \"User\") is a complex and multifaceted decision process. Restart does not does not have the authority or ability to assign empirical risks levels nor make definitive use decisions for any User. Rather, the Model provides one approach to making recommendations that can help Users make decisions about their potential equipment uses by allowing them to calculate their potential requirements. Users are strongly encouraged to consider other sources of information and expressly disclaim any cause of action they may have against Restart arising from or relating to the Model or its analysis. Implementing the equipment levels projected by the Model will not eliminate the risk of COID-19 cases being linked to activites in an economy or workplace. In this context, it is important to note that this equipment alone will not eliminate the risk of infection. All Users should remain informed about and abide by any decisions made by local public health and government authorities regarding specific mitigation efforts, including equipment in the model, as the situation is dynamic."
